## API Usage

This app uses the public GitHub API:

- Endpoints used:
  - `https://api.github.com/users/{username}`
  - `https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos`

## Troubleshooting

- **User not found**: Double check the username spelling
- **No repositories shown**: The user may not have public repositories
- **Rate limit exceeded**: Wait an hour or provide a GitHub token in the future
